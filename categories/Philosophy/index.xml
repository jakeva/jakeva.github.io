      <description>I recently got stoned for the first time in several years with Caleen. Whoa buddy. Like no time had passed at all. Instantly back where I was when I was a 24/7 stoner (about from 2007 to 2015).
I thought I might try to write about what it&amp;rsquo;s like for me. I think everyone&amp;rsquo;s experience is distinct, like a fingerprint of your soul. Caleen and I talked about it a little bit.</description>
