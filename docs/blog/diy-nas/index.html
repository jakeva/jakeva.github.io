<p>I had a couple old NAS storage solutions I pulled out of, well, my storage unit a while back. Tried to set them up in my office and found them to be really difficult to use, but the data on them is still good. So I pulled the disks out and decided to look into upgrading to something newer. After some research, I concluded the existing out-of-the-box solutions available are overpriced for what they offer. I decided I wanted more control over the parts to reduce cost, as well as having more freedom in setting up the server software so I looked into building my own.</p>

<p>I used <a href="https://pcpartpicker.com">PC Partpicker</a> to help me narrow down what I was looking for. I went in blind hoping I&rsquo;d find a tower suitable for what I wanted, and I think I found the perfect one. Everything else was selected to fit it.</p>

<td>This is particularly recommended for a NAS build. Both on Amazon and Newegg, reviews were a bit mixed but for a little over $100 I decided I could handle a few imperfections. Right now I have 7 3.5&quot; drives ranging from 1 to 4 TB, and 1 2.5&quot; SSD I want to use as the boot disk. Between disk bay utilization and cooling options, this tower promises some pretty interesting flexibility. In their own words, it has a &ldquo;Unique hard drive mounting system, fitting up to 8 x 3.5&rdquo;, 4 x 2.5&quot; or up to 10 x 3.5&quot;, 2 x 2.5&quot; drives HDD/SSD&quot; all inside a 13.5 x 12 x 15.3in package. That&rsquo;s 12 slots for hard drives! That should fit my needs perfectly with plenty of room for future upgrades and fit nicely under my desk.</td>

<td>At first I was just interested in picking up a 2 core CPU since I intend on doing nothing with this machine except serving up files to my home network. I&rsquo;m the only user, so I don&rsquo;t need much CPU. However, I found it tricky to pair up a 2 core CPU with a motherboard so I just picked a reasonable quad core. It might be a little over kill, but that&rsquo;s ok.</td>
<td>$107.68</td>

<tr>
<td>I had more trouble finding the right motherboard. I ordered a cheap one early on, forgetting to check how many SATA slots it had. What I ordered was the <a href="https://pcpartpicker.com/product/RD97YJ/asrock-b450m-hdv-r40-micro-atx-am4-motherboard-b450m-hdv-r40">ASRock B450M-HDV R4.0 Micro ATX AM4 Motherboard</a></td>

<p>This brings the total to a little over $500. By comparison you can get an <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Synology-Bay-Diskstation-Diskless-DS1819/dp/B07KMKDW42/">8 bay NAS by Synology</a> for $931.</p>

<p>I haven&rsquo;t got all the parts yet, but I&rsquo;ll post an update when I get it built and have a chance to play with it. I expect there will be some tradeoffs, like the interior will probably be a bit cramped and hard to work with. Maybe it will get a little hot or loud with the four fans. But I&rsquo;m excited, I didn&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;d be able to find a solution that would fit 10 drives in around a square foot of floor space. At less than $500, for me it&rsquo;s a no brainer.</p>
<h2 id="and-whats-next">
  And what&rsquo;s next?
  <a class="anchor" href="#and-whats-next">#</a>
</h2>
<p>Of course, I&rsquo;m already thinking down the road. Right now I only have a little over 12 TBs of hard drives ready to put to use (consisting mostly of Bluray backups and music), but at $485 for a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Seagate-IronWolf-16TB-Internal-Drive/dp/B07SGGWYC1">16 TB Drive</a> I am imagining a world where I spend a small fortune for a +13x increase and while I&rsquo;ll probably never need it, it is pretty fun to imagine.</p>
<h2 id="small-update">
  Small Update
  <a class="anchor" href="#small-update">#</a>
</h2>
<p>Ok so I bought two of the 16 TB drives intending to get a simple mirror up. Funny story, I snapped the plastic on the sata connector of one of them trying to fit it into the case. It is pretty tight in there. Anyway, I bought a third to replace it. But by the time it arrived I decided it was worth trying to salvage the broken one. The pins were still there and I had the broken off plastic piece, so I sort of put it back together delicately and slid it all back in. It worked! The system connected to the drive and now I&rsquo;ve got a healthy 32 TB Raid Z1 pool running in my FreeNAS!</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m working now on setting up torrenting over OpenVPN among other things. I&rsquo;ll write some of that up in separate blog posts.</p>
