      <description>Shanghai and Suzhou #  Shanghai is, of course, amazing. We also took some time to visit a small (for the chinese) nearby town called Suzhou. Incredible beauty and history.

      <description>Beijing #  Beijing is huge. I mean… just huge. There&amp;rsquo;s really no other way to put it. Everywhere you go, everything is overwhelming. From the size of the buildings to the number of people. It was here that I ate a roasted tarantula on a $500 dare from my brother. I should mention my dad at one first. So I knew it was safe.

      <title>Chengdu (Sichuan Province)</title>

      <description>Chengdu #  Chengdu felt a little more less overwhelming. Still a much larger city than most people in the United States would be used to, but we stayed in an area of the city that could have been mistaken for Chicago, except with everything written in Chinese. And everyone around is Chinese. And they eat crab eggs and fish heads.
The highlight, aside from encountering &amp;ldquo;Hot Pot&amp;rdquo; for the first time was visiting the national Panda zoo!</description>
